summary			"Display a spinning barberpole with a message"
Description			"This CLI utility displays a spinning barberpole with a message (default: 'Please wait ...') while your script or program is doing something that may take a long, but unknown, time.

When you no longer want to display the barberpole, you can remove it in two ways:

 hey barberpole quit
 kill barberpole

barberpole uses bbjimmy's spinner library.

barberpole also has special facilities for yab programmers, who can do all this and more on-the-fly. Please see the documentation for details.
